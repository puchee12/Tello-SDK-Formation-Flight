NOTICE THAT..
Userâ€™s PC is highly recommended to use Ubuntu version 18.04, this is because the USB driver of T4U Wifi adaptor only supports Ubuntu version up to 18.04

Please find published (Tello-SDK-Formation-Flight) GitHub repository provided in link below,
https://github.com/puchee12/Tello-SDK-Formation-Flight
In this repository the amd64 type disk image of Ubuntu 18.04.03 version is not found since the file is too big, please do request the image for it via my email address, puchee12.bp@gmail.com

Each Tello is connected to user's PC by using Wifi adaptors (Tplink T4U) which provides unique netword interface ID. This basically allows each Tello to be connected to a single ground control station.
Instructions of installing USB driver for the adaptor can be found in the official website https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/download/archer-t4u/#Driver also installation manual can be found in the same directory.

Formation flight videos can be seen in YouTube channel,
